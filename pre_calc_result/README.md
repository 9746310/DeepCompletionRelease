# Pre-computed Result of Our Method

For the sake of comparison, we provide our results on Matterport3D and ScanNet. Please check [`./torch/data_list/`] folder for the list of testing images. Since the testing data also comes from original dataset, you need to get access before downloading the pre-computed results.

Files you will get upon dataset access:
- matterport_normal.zip: result on Matterport3D (Require Matterport3D access)
- scannet_normal.zip: result on ScanNet (Require ScanNet access)
