### Pre-computed Result of Our Method

We evaluate on Matterport3D and ScanNet. Please check [`torch`] folder for the list of testing images. Since the testing data also comes from original dataset, you need the get dataset access before downloading the pre-computed results.

Files you will get upon dataset access:
- matterport_normal.zip: result on Matterport3D
- scannet_normal.zip: result on ScanNet
