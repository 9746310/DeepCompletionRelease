### Training Data

We provide a small dataset collected by Intel Realsense for quick testing:
- realsense.zip: http://deepcompletion.cs.princeton.edu/ddc_release/public/data/realsense.zip      

Here is a list of data you may get upon SUNCG/Matterport3D/ScanNet access:
- matterport_render_depth.zip: The depth rendered from mesh reconstruction for scenes from Matterport3D.
- matterport_render_normal.zip: The surface normal for the rendered depth from Matterport3D.
- scannet_render_depth.zip: The depth rendered from mesh reconstruction for scenes from ScanNet.
- scannet_render_normal.zip: The surface normal for the rendered depth from ScanNet.
- pbrs_boundary.zip: The boundary ground truth for physically based rendering in SUNCG-RGBD dataset.
